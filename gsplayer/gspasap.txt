Another Slight Atari Player - GSPlayer plugin
---------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for GSPlayer that makes it possible to play Atari 8-bit music
stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply put gspasap.dll
in the directory that contains the GSPlayer executable.

The plugin has some configuration. You can specify a time limit for songs
that do not define playback time. You can also choose if songs marked
as looping should finish when the loop starts or not.

At the moment the plugin plays only the default subsong and gives no access
to other subsongs in the file.

How to use
----------

To embed the player in your web page, use the following XHTML syntax:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<object width="0" height="0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="asap.swf" id="asap">
    <param name="movie" value="asap.swf" />
    <param name="FlashVars" value="file=File.sap&song=2" />
</object>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(tested with Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 3.5 and Chrome 19).

The player will play the specified file. It doesn't display anything.

The player understands the following parameters (in ampersand-separated `FlashVars`):

- `file` - URL of the file to play.
- `song` - zero-based subsong number.
- `onLoad` - JavaScript code or function name to be executed when file is loaded.
This is a safe place to call `getTitle()` etc - see below.
Playback starts after the JavaScript code/function returns.
- `onPlaybackEnd` - JavaScript code or function name to be executed when song playback ends.
Will not be called as a result of `asapStop()`.

All the above parameters are optional.

The player contains the following methods that can be called from JavaScript:

- `asapPlay(filename : String, song : int = -1) : void` - plays the specified song (-1 for the default)
- `asapStop() : void` - stops playback
- `getAuthor() : String` - returns the AUTHOR tag of the playing song
- `getTitle() : String` - returns the NAME tag of the playing song
- `getDate() : String` - returns the DATE tag of the playing song

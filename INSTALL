Getting source code
-------------------

If you want to compile an official release of ASAP, get the source
distribution (asap-*.tar.gz) and uncompress it to a directory
of your choice.
On Unix-like systems:
tar zxf asap-*.tar.gz
On Windows you may use 7-Zip.
Source distributions of ASAP include the part of Atari800 emulator sources
used by ASAP (POKEY and 6502 emulation).

If you instead want to compile the latest version from the CVS, checkout
the "asap" module of the "asap" project and the "atari800" module
of the "atari800" project into the same directory (so it contains
the subdirectories "asap" and "atari800" after the checkouts).
Using a command-line CVS client:
mkdir asap-cvs
cd asap-cvs
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/asap co -P asap
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/atari800 co -P atari800


Building ASAP2WAV on Unix-like systems
--------------------------------------

You need perl, a C compiler/library and GNU make.

From your shell prompt navigate to the "asap" directory (the one that
contains "asap.c").

If you got the sources from CVS, you additionally need the "autoconf"
package and must run the following commands first:
autoconf
autoheader

To compile and install, run the following commands:
./configure
gmake
gmake install
The last command must be run with super-user priviledges.
Use "make" if there's no "gmake".

If you have no super-user priviledges or want to install the program
in a non-standard location, you can specify the "--prefix" option
for the "configure" script, or simply copy the compiled program
instead of executing "gmake install".


Building ASAP2WAV, WASAP and the Winamp plugin on Windows
---------------------------------------------------------

You need a Microsoft C/C++ compiler, Windows Platform SDK and Perl.
I have tested only Visual C++ 2005 Express, Platform SDK for Windows
Server 2003 SP1 and ActivePerl 5.8.7.

You need to set "Path", "INCLUDE" and "LIB" environment variables
to point at the correct locations in VC++ and PSDK.
"perl" should be on the "Path", too.

From the command prompt navigate to the "win32" directory and run:
nmake

This will produce asap2wav.exe, wasap.exe and winamp\in_asap.dll.

ASAP - Another Slight Atari Player
----------------------------------

ASAP is a player/converter of Atari 8-bit music for modern computers.
It provides high-quality, identical to the popular Atari800 emulator,
emulation of the POKEY sound chip and the 6502 processor.

This release includes the following programs that use the ASAP engine:
* ASAP2WAV - portable command-line utility that generates WAV files
* WASAP - a tiny player for Windows
* in_asap - a Winamp plugin

Currently supported input formats are:
* SAP (Slight Atari Player) - a standard file format for playing Atari 8-bit
  music on modern computers. Samples and stereo are not supported yet.
* CMC (Chaos Music Composer) - a popular music editor for Atari.
* CMR (CMC Rzog) - CMC with modified bass sounds.
* DMC (DoublePlay CMC) - CMC with 6502 routines executed at double rate
  of the original CMC.
* MPT (Music ProTracker) - another popular music editor for Atari.
  Samples are not supported yet.
* MPD (MPT DoublePlay) - MPT with 6502 routines executed at double rate
  of the original MPT.
* RMT (Raster Music Tracker) - new music editor for composing Atari music
  on a PC. Stereo is not supported yet.
* TMC (Theta Music Composer) - powerful music editor for Atari.
  Stereo is not supported yet.

More formats will be added in the future. Also, lack of support for stereo
and samples is only temporary.

The biggest collection of SAP files is ASMA (Atari SAP Music Archive,
http://asma.atari.org). It is strongly recommended that you use ASMA 3.0
or newer. About 400 files in ASMA 3.0 are stereo or with samples,
the remaining 1600 can be used with the current version of ASAP.

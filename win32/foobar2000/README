Another Slight Atari Player - foobar2000 plugin
-----------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for foobar 2000 version 0.9 that makes it possible to play
Atari 8-bit music stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply
extract foo_asap.dll to the "components" directory of your foobar2000
installation (normally "C:\Program Files\foobar2000").

The plugin does support subsongs, which appear as separate items
on the playlist. foobar2000's default title formating doesn't include subsong
numbers however, so the subsongs look the same on the playlist.
To fix this problem, open File / Preferences / Display / Title formatting
and before "$tab()" in the edit box insert something like this:
$ifgreater(%_subsong%,0, - subsong $add(1,%_subsong%),)
- this will add 1-based numbers to all subsongs except for subsong 1
(90% of SAPs in ASMA contain just one song). More advanced title formatting
(including total number of subsongs, AUTHOR/NAME tags, etc) will be possible
in future versions of ASAP.

This plugin is part of the ASAP project. Information about ASAP follows.

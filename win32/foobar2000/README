Another Slight Atari Player - foobar2000 plugin
-----------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for foobar 2000 version 0.8 that makes it possible to play
Atari 8-bit music stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply
extract foo_asap.dll to the "components" directory of your foobar2000
installation (normally "C:\Program Files\foobar2000").

At the moment the plugin does not support multiple songs per file, seeking,
file information, configuration nor song lengths (you need to manually switch
between the files on the playlist).

This plugin is part of the ASAP project. Information about ASAP follows.

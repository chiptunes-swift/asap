Another Slight Atari Player - foobar2000 plugin
-----------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for foobar 2000 version 0.9 that makes it possible to play
Atari 8-bit music stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply
extract foo_asap.dll to the "components" directory of your foobar2000
installation (normally "C:\Program Files\foobar2000").

The plugin now has some configuration. You can specify a time limit for songs
that do not define playback time. You can also choose if songs marked
as looping should finish when the loop starts or not.

The plugin does support subsongs, which appear as separate items
on the playlist. foobar2000's default title formating doesn't include subsong
numbers however, so the subsongs appear the same on the playlist.
To fix this problem, open File / Preferences / Display / Title formatting
and before "$tab()" in the edit box insert something like this:
$ifgreater($info(subsongs), 1, - song $add(1,%_subsong%),)
- this will add subsong numbers to files that contain subsongs.

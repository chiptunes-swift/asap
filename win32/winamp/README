Another Slight Atari Player - Winamp plugin
-------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for Winamp that makes it possible to play Atari 8-bit music
stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply extract in_asap.dll
to the "Plugins" directory of your Winamp installation. It is also recommended
that you remove other plugins that support Atari 8-bit music.

The plugin now has some configuration. You can specify a time limit for songs
that do not define playback time. You can also choose if songs marked
as looping should finish when the loop starts or not.

At the moment the plugin plays only the default subsong and gives no access
to other subsongs in the file.

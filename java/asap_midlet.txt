Another Slight Atari Player - J2ME midlet
-----------------------------------------

This is an experimental port of ASAP to Java 2 MicroEdition.
The midlet will not work on devices with old J2ME implementations.
The midlet has a file browser for selecting Atari 8-bit music files,
which should be stored in phone memory or on a memory card.

Any feedback regarding the midlet (whether it works on your mobile
phone or whether it doesn't) is appreciated. Please include your
device model and error messages, if any.

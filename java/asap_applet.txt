Another Slight Atari Player - Java applet
-----------------------------------------

To embed this applet in a web page, use the following HTML syntax:

<applet width="40" height="45" code="ASAPApplet" archive="asap_applet.jar">
	<param name="file" value="File.sap" />
</applet>

The applet will play the specified file and display POKEY channel volume
meters scaled to the applet size (you can specify a different size).
There are four volume meters for mono music and eight for stereo.

The applet understands the following parameters:
- "file": URL of the file to play
- "song": zero-based subsong number
- "defaultPlaybackTime": playback time for songs with unspecified duration,
  in the "mm:ss.xxx" format
- "loopPlaybackTime": playback time for songs marked as looping
- "background": background color specified as six hexadecimal digits ("rrggbb")
- "foreground": volume bars color specified as six hexadecimal digits ("rrggbb")
- "onPlaybackEnd": JavaScript to be executed when playback ends

The applet contains the following methods that can be used from JavaScript:
- void play(String filename, int song, String defaultPlaybackTime, String loopPlaybackTime):
  plays the specified song
- void stop(): stops playback
- boolean togglePause(): toggles pause and returns true if pause has been enabled

Remember to add the "mayscript" attribute to the applet when interfacing with JavaScript.

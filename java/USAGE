Java applet
-----------

To embed the applet in a web page, use the following HTML syntax:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<applet width="40" height="45" code="ASAPApplet" archive="asap_applet.jar">
    <param name="file" value="File.sap" />
</applet>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The applet will play the specified file and display POKEY channel volume
meters scaled to the applet size (you can specify a different size).
There are four volume meters for mono music and eight for stereo.

The applet understands the following parameters:

- `file` - URL of the file to play
- `song` - zero-based subsong number
- `defaultPlaybackTime` - playback time for songs with unspecified duration,
  in the "mm:ss.xxx" format
- `loopPlaybackTime` - playback time for songs marked as looping
- `background` - background color specified as six hexadecimal digits ("rrggbb")
- `foreground` - volume bars color specified as six hexadecimal digits ("rrggbb")
- `onPlaybackEnd` - JavaScript to be executed when playback ends

The applet contains the following methods that can be called from JavaScript:

- `void play(String filename, int song, String defaultPlaybackTime, String loopPlaybackTime)` -
  plays the specified song
- `void stop()` - stops playback
- `boolean togglePause()` - toggles pause and returns `true` if pause has been enabled

Remember to add the `mayscript` attribute to the `applet` element
when interfacing with JavaScript.


Java midlet
-----------

Midlet is an application for mobile phones.
The ASAP midlet requires CLDC 1.1 and MIDP 2.0
and thus will not work on old Java implementations.
The midlet has a file browser for selecting music files,
which should be stored in phone memory or on a memory card.
